# Inform7 Pronouns

Code for flexible handling of pronouns in http://www.inform7.com, used for
authoring interactive fiction.

## Non-binary Gender

"Non-binary Gender" is an extension for Inform7, allowing the definition of new
groups of pronouns and ascribe one or more of them to things within a story,
including support for "singular they".

Find the extension file itself
[here](Non-binary%20Gender.i7xp/Source/extension.i7x).

## Non-binary Gender Testing

This extension is only meant for use in developing the extension above,
comparing the behavior of Inform with and without that extension.
